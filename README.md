# Uxpload

## Basic deployment:

Clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:jonfm/uxpload.git
    cd uxpload

For now, we create the upload dir manually:

    mkdir uploads (must be writable by the node process)

Install node dependencies:

    npm install

Run the server:

    node server.js

Then hit http://localhost:3000/ from your browser...
